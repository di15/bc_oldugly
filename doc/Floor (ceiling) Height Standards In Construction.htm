 there is no set rule . 10ft. is common  but it is subject to minimum ceiling heights with very depending on your codes in the area you live . Basements and such use to be 7&#39;10&quot; if I remember right but a few years back it was dropped to 7&#39;1&#39;&#39; .<br />The typical is a 9 &#39; interval if the ceilings are 8 ft.  Leaving a 1 ft. interval for floor systems  , but that is not truly accurate. If you want to get technical the typical ceiling is 8&#39; 1 and a quarter inches . Then 2x10s are 9 and a half inches then you add 3/4 sub-floor before you start the next wall of 8&#39;1 and a quarter inches. A big percentage of profesionals just call it 8ft plus 10 inches and call it good . The only way you get a dispute about it is when you have a height restriction and every quarter inch makes a difference in the over all height as to not pierce the building height envelope.<br />It gets a lot more continuous when there is a perceived view shed of a neighbor. <br /><br />10 ft. is a standard depending on the type of building , ceiling heights, chase area size for ducts and stuff . It is a rule of thumb and don&#39;t reflect real live measurements of an as-built. <br />you take commercial space and the ceilings could easily be 12ft or even 15 foot then have a drop ceiling down to a desired height for a particular store design and if there is a second story  it may only be the thickness of the floor system it self  which could be just a 1/8th inches corrugated metal with 3 and one half inches of reinforced concrete  then start the next floor .<br />I think standard single story big malls have a ceiling height of 23 ft.  <br />I may be wrong about that . I think that is right though . It has been a while since i have done a tenant improvement in a mall . 23 ft comes to mind  . <br />So my typical is 10 ft. when estimating initial heights. Very preliminary when trying to visualize a highest and best use for a land parcel. <br />That is because of peoples desire for 9 ft tall walls , which we say a lot of in the hay day before the crash . Everybody wanted 9 ft walls
